Other notes:
If I were given more time, the first thing I would work on is the CSS. 
In terms of refactoring, I would try to make code a lot DRYer, especially in the returns of HTML elements. I would also would like to determine if there is any unnecessary code that I am creating that I can instead get by referring to other pieces of code.

In any case, thank you Aspen Capital for the opportunity. I have to make this repo private as soon as I can.
